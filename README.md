<h2>About this plugin</h2>

This Napari plugin was designed for the detection and quantification of periodic biological structures.
As this plugin has not been uploaded to napari-hub as of this moment it **cannot be installed on a pre-compiled, bundled 
version of Napari**. Therefor Napari will need to be installed as a python package 
(<a href="https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html">more info about Napari installation</a>). 
Further information about the installation and licensing of the plugin can be found below. 

<h3>Background</h3>

Actin is the most abundant protein in eukaryotic cells. As it is part of the cytoskelleton its function essential for 
the maintenance of cell's morfological structure. In neurons, it was only recently that researchers started paying 
attention to the peculiar subcelular orgazation and localization of actin. First focussed on the dentritic spines, 
later expanding to the axon.  

The axon initial segment (AIS) is defines as the most proximal 30-60 Âµm of the axon and is known for its sturdy actin-betaIV cytoskeletal structure which is known to facilitate the densely packed ion channels, regulatory and scaffolding proteins on the membrane.
